This file contains a list of tasks and improvements to be made in the project.

- [ ] Implement unit tests.
- [ ] Create docs using mkdocs
- [ ] ReferenceEmbeddings: store embeddings as numpy arrays instead of dicts to improve performance. Identities can be stored in a separate list or array matching the order of embeddings.
- [ ] ReferenceEmbeddings: add method to remove identities and their embeddings.
- [ ] ReferenceEmbeddings: add method to add new identities.
- [ ] ReferenceEmbeddings: add method update embeddings of existing identities.
